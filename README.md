# MediaServer
Contains software for my jellyfin media server 

## Setup
Flash a 16GB SD card with the latest version of [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/).
For raspberry pi 3b and 3b+:
```32 bit OS (Raspberry Pi OS Lite)``` is better as it consumes less RAM.
For raspberry pi 4:
```64 bit OS (Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64 bit))``` is better as it has more RAM and can take advantage of the architecture.

On ubuntu it is preferrable to flash the SD card with [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
